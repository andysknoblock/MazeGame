# MazeGame
This game is completetedISH. To play, download the DankMaze folder and run the jar file in it. Ensure it remains in the DankMaze folder with the data and maze files otherwise it will not run. Also, delete the readme.md in the customMazes folder for ideal performance.    
This game will allows a player to traverse premade mazes in 16 premade levels. This game includes a menu, level selector, level editor, and hopefully more. The player navigates mazes with keyboard input, and is able to create and edit their own custom levels via mouse. The classes are in the /src folder.
